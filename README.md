# ShadowAnalysis

## About
This project came about while talking to a friend about the setting Sun and the ability to see it as it disappears under the horizon. I was hoping to brush up on some old skills and learn some new tools while simultaneously answering this question. I used my limited knowledge of LaTex and markdown to get started then used R to view data, solve for equations, and plot. Had to relearn how to do trig too.
